# JSON controller

This library is similar to the [http](https://github.com/mimbre/http) one, except that It is focused for those applications that use JSON documents. The library contains two classes, `JsonController` and `JsonView`, that extend `HttpController` and `HttpView` respectively. To know more details, visit the [http](https://github.com/mimbre/http) library.
